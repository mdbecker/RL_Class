For this lesson, we'll focus on **PPO**, a versatile and widely used policy-based method known for its robustness and efficiency.

---

## **Implementing PPO with Stable Baselines3**

### **Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries**

Begin by importing the essential libraries required for implementing PPO using SB3.

```python
import gym
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
from stable_baselines3.common.evaluation import evaluate_policy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### **Step 2: Initialize the Environment**

We'll use the **CartPole-v1** environment for this example, which is a classic control problem where the agent must balance a pole on a moving cart.

```python
# Initialize the CartPole environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
```

### **Step 3: Create and Train the PPO Agent**

Using SB3, creating and training a PPO agent is straightforward. We'll instantiate the PPO model with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) policy and train it for a specified number of timesteps.

```python
# Create the PPO agent
model = PPO('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=1)

# Train the agent
model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)
```

**Explanation:**
- **'MlpPolicy':** Specifies a policy network with fully connected layers.
- **verbose=1:** Enables detailed logging during training.

### **Step 4: Evaluate the Trained Agent**

After training, it's essential to evaluate the agent's performance to understand how well it has learned to solve the environment.

```python
# Evaluate the agent's performance
mean_reward, std_reward = evaluate_policy(model, env, n_eval_episodes=100)

print(f"Mean Reward: {mean_reward} +/- {std_reward}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Mean Reward: 200.0 +/- 0.0
```
*Note: In deterministic environments like CartPole-v1 with `is_slippery=False`, the agent may consistently achieve the maximum reward.*

### **Step 5: Visualize Agent Performance**

Visualizing the agent's performance helps in understanding its behavior and verifying that it has learned an effective policy.

```python
# Function to visualize the agent
def visualize_agent(env, model, num_episodes=5):
    """
    Visualizes the agent's performance in the environment.
    
    Args:
        env (gym.Env): The environment to visualize.
        model (stable_baselines3.PPO): The trained PPO model.
        num_episodes (int): Number of episodes to visualize.
    """
    for episode in range(1, num_episodes + 1):
        state = env.reset()
        done = False
        total_reward = 0
        while not done:
            env.render()  # Render the environment
            action, _states = model.predict(state, deterministic=True)
            state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
            total_reward += reward
        print(f"Episode {episode}: Total Reward: {total_reward}")
    env.close()

# Visualize the trained agent
visualize_agent(env, model)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Episode 1: Total Reward: 200
Episode 2: Total Reward: 200
...
```

*Figure: The environment will render visually in a separate window, showing the cart balancing the pole successfully.*

### **Step 6: Plot Training Progress**

Although SB3 provides internal logging, plotting rewards over episodes can offer additional insights into the agent's learning curve.

```python
# Plotting the rewards (requires modifying the training loop to store rewards)
# Since SB3 abstracts the training loop, we can use callbacks or other logging mechanisms.

# Example using a callback to log rewards
from stable_baselines3.common.callbacks import BaseCallback

class RewardLoggerCallback(BaseCallback):
    """
    Custom callback for logging rewards.
    """
    def __init__(self, verbose=0):
        super(RewardLoggerCallback, self).__init__(verbose)
        self.episode_rewards = []
    
    def _on_step(self) -> bool:
        if 'episode_rewards' in self.locals:
            self.episode_rewards.append(self.locals['episode_rewards'])
        return True

# Initialize the callback
reward_logger = RewardLoggerCallback()

# Train the agent with the callback
model.learn(total_timesteps=10000, callback=reward_logger)

# Plot the reward history
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(reward_logger.episode_rewards, color='blue')
plt.xlabel('Episode')
plt.ylabel('Total Reward')
plt.title('PPO: Reward per Episode')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

**Note:** SB3's training loop is abstracted, so to log rewards per episode, we use a custom callback.

**Expected Output:**

![Reward per Episode](https://i.imgur.com/9KX5Zc1.gif)

*Figure: The plot shows the rewards obtained by the agent in each episode, indicating learning progress.*

### **Step 7: Save and Load the Trained Model**

Saving and loading models allows you to reuse trained agents without retraining.

```python
# Save the trained model
model.save("ppo_cartpole")

# To load the model later
# model = PPO.load("ppo_cartpole", env=env)
```

### **Step 8: Compare with Custom Policy Gradient Implementation**

Comparing SB3's PPO with the custom Policy Gradient implementation from **Lesson 4.2** highlights the advantages of using optimized, library-based algorithms.

**Key Comparisons:**
- **Performance:** SB3's PPO often converges faster and achieves higher rewards due to optimized implementations.
- **Ease of Use:** SB3 abstracts much of the complexity, allowing quick experimentation with different algorithms and hyperparameters.
- **Flexibility:** While custom implementations offer deeper insights, SB3 provides flexibility through its extensive API for customization.
- **Stability:** SB3's algorithms include advanced techniques like clipping in PPO to ensure stable training.

## **Interactive Activity**

### **1. Train on a Different Environment**

**Task:** Replace `CartPole-v1` with another Gym environment (e.g., `MountainCar-v0`) and observe performance.

```python
# Initialize the MountainCar environment
env = gym.make('MountainCar-v0')

# Create the PPO agent
model = PPO('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=1)

# Train the agent
model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)

# Evaluate the agent's performance
mean_reward, std_reward = evaluate_policy(model, env, n_eval_episodes=100)

print(f"Mean Reward: {mean_reward} +/- {std_reward}")

# Visualize the trained agent
visualize_agent(env, model, num_episodes=3)
```

**Observation:** The `MountainCar-v0` environment is more challenging, requiring the agent to build momentum to reach the goal. Observe how PPO adapts to this environment and compare the learning curve with that of `CartPole-v1`.

### **2. Adjust Hyperparameters**

**Task:** Modify PPO's hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, or number of epochs to see their effect on training.

```python
# Example: Change learning rate and number of epochs
model = PPO('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=1, learning_rate=3e-4, n_epochs=20)

# Train the agent with new hyperparameters
model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)

# Evaluate the agent's performance
mean_reward, std_reward = evaluate_policy(model, env, n_eval_episodes=100)

print(f"Mean Reward: {mean_reward} +/- {std_reward}")
```

**Observation:** Adjusting hyperparameters can significantly impact the speed and stability of learning. A lower learning rate may slow down convergence, while increasing the number of epochs can lead to more thorough policy updates per rollout.

### **3. Compare with Other Algorithms**

**Task:** Experiment with other policy-based algorithms like **A2C** or **SAC** provided by SB3 and compare results.

```python
from stable_baselines3 import A2C, SAC

# Initialize the A2C agent
a2c_model = A2C('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=1)
a2c_model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)

# Evaluate A2C agent
mean_reward_a2c, std_reward_a2c = evaluate_policy(a2c_model, env, n_eval_episodes=100)
print(f"A2C Mean Reward: {mean_reward_a2c} +/- {std_reward_a2c}")

# Initialize the SAC agent (note: SAC is typically used for continuous action spaces)
sac_env = gym.make('Pendulum-v1')  # Example of a continuous action space environment
sac_model = SAC('MlpPolicy', sac_env, verbose=1)
sac_model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)

# Evaluate SAC agent
mean_reward_sac, std_reward_sac = evaluate_policy(sac_model, sac_env, n_eval_episodes=100)
print(f"SAC Mean Reward: {mean_reward_sac} +/- {std_reward_sac}")
```

**Observation:** Different algorithms have varying strengths. **A2C** is an on-policy method that can be faster in some environments, while **SAC** is suited for continuous action spaces. Comparing their performance helps in selecting the right algorithm for specific tasks.

### **4. Implement Callback Functions**

**Task:** Use custom callbacks to log additional metrics or implement early stopping based on specific criteria.

```python
from stable_baselines3.common.callbacks import BaseCallback

class CustomCallback(BaseCallback):
    """
    Custom callback for logging additional metrics or implementing early stopping.
    """
    def __init__(self, verbose=0):
        super(CustomCallback, self).__init__(verbose)
        self.episode_rewards = []
    
    def _on_step(self) -> bool:
        if 'episode_rewards' in self.locals:
            self.episode_rewards.append(self.locals['episode_rewards'])
            # Example: Implement early stopping if average reward exceeds a threshold
            if len(self.episode_rewards) >= 100:
                avg_reward = np.mean(self.episode_rewards[-100:])
                if avg_reward > 195:
                    print(f"Stopping training early at step {self.num_timesteps} with average reward {avg_reward}")
                    return False
        return True

# Initialize the callback
custom_callback = CustomCallback()

# Train the PPO agent with the custom callback
model = PPO('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=1)
model.learn(total_timesteps=10000, callback=custom_callback)
```

**Observation:** Callbacks can enhance training by providing custom logging, early stopping, model checkpointing, and more, allowing for more controlled and insightful training processes.

   # Initialize the PPO agent with TensorBoard logging
   model = PPO('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=1, tensorboard_log="./ppo_cartpole_tensorboard/")
   
   # Train the agent with TensorBoard callback
   model.learn(total_timesteps=10000, callback=TensorboardCallback())
   ```
   
   To visualize:
   
   ```bash
   # In terminal, run:
   tensorboard --logdir=./ppo_cartpole_tensorboard/
   ```
   
   Then, open the provided URL in your browser to monitor training metrics.
   
5. **Save and Share Models:**
   - Regularly save trained models to prevent loss of progress and to facilitate sharing and deployment.
   
   ```python
   # Save the trained model
   model.save("ppo_cartpole")
   
   # Load the model
   # model = PPO.load("ppo_cartpole", env=env)
   ```
   
6. **Understand the Algorithm:**
   - While SB3 abstracts the complexity, understanding the underlying algorithm (e.g., PPO) helps in making informed decisions about hyperparameter tuning and troubleshooting.
   
7. **Utilize SB3's Documentation and Community:**
   - Refer to SB3's [official documentation](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) for detailed guidance and leverage community forums for support and advanced use-cases.

   from stable_baselines3.common.torch_layers import BaseFeaturesExtractor
   
   class CustomCNN(BaseFeaturesExtractor):
       def __init__(self, observation_space: gym.spaces.Box, features_dim: int = 256):
           super(CustomCNN, self).__init__(observation_space, features_dim)
           # Define custom CNN architecture here
       
       def forward(self, observations: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
           # Define forward pass
           return observations
           
   # Use the custom extractor in the policy
   policy_kwargs = dict(features_extractor_class=CustomCNN)
   model = PPO('CnnPolicy', env, policy_kwargs=policy_kwargs, verbose=1)
   ```
   
10. **Benchmark and Compare Algorithms:**
    - Regularly benchmark different algorithms on the same environment to identify which performs best for your specific task.
    
    ```python
    from stable_baselines3 import A2C, DQN, SAC
    
    # Initialize different agents
    a2c_model = A2C('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=1)
    dqn_model = DQN('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=1)
    sac_model = SAC('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=1)
    
    # Train the agents
    a2c_model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)
    dqn_model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)
    sac_model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)
    
    # Evaluate the agents
    mean_reward_a2c, _ = evaluate_policy(a2c_model, env, n_eval_episodes=100)
    mean_reward_dqn, _ = evaluate_policy(dqn_model, env, n_eval_episodes=100)
    mean_reward_sac, _ = evaluate_policy(sac_model, env, n_eval_episodes=100)
    
    print(f"A2C Mean Reward: {mean_reward_a2c}")
    print(f"DQN Mean Reward: {mean_reward_dqn}")
    print(f"SAC Mean Reward: {mean_reward_sac}")
    ```
    
    **Observation:** Different algorithms excel in different environments. For instance, DQN is well-suited for discrete action spaces, while SAC is ideal for continuous actions.
