# **Lesson 3.2: The Bellman Equation Simplified**

## **Learning Objectives**
- **Comprehend the Bellman Equation** for value updates.
- **Implement the Bellman update** in code.
- **Understand the recursive nature** of the Bellman Equation.
- **Visualize value function updates** through iterative processes.
- **Analyze the convergence behavior** of value functions.

## **Description**
The **Bellman Equation** is a fundamental recursive relationship in Reinforcement Learning that defines how value functions are updated based on expected rewards and transitions. In this lesson, we'll break down the Bellman Equation into manageable parts, implement it in code, and visualize how value functions evolve over iterations. Understanding the Bellman Equation is crucial for developing and analyzing various RL algorithms, such as Value Iteration and Q-Learning.

---
  
## **Why the Bellman Equation Matters**

The Bellman Equation provides a **principled way** to compute the value of states and actions by decomposing the value function into immediate rewards and the value of subsequent states. This recursive decomposition is essential for:
- **Policy Evaluation:** Assessing how good a policy is.
- **Policy Improvement:** Enhancing policies based on value estimates.
- **Algorithm Design:** Serving as the foundation for many RL algorithms.

Understanding the Bellman Equation allows you to grasp how agents can iteratively improve their value estimates to make better decisions.

---
  
## **Understanding the Bellman Equation**

The Bellman Equation provides a recursive relationship for value functions, enabling the computation of **V(s)** and **Q(s, a)** based on expected future rewards and transitions.

### **Bellman Equation for State-Value Function**

\[
V^{\pi}(s) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \left[ R_{t+1} + \gamma V^{\pi}(S_{t+1}) \mid S_t = s \right]
\]

- **\( V^{\pi}(s) \)**: Expected cumulative reward starting from state \( s \) and following policy \( \pi \).
- **\( R_{t+1} \)**: Immediate reward after taking action.
- **\( \gamma \)**: Discount factor (\( 0 \leq \gamma < 1 \)) prioritizing immediate rewards over distant ones.

### **Bellman Equation for Action-Value Function**

\[
Q^{\pi}(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \left[ R_{t+1} + \gamma Q^{\pi}(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}) \mid S_t = s, A_t = a \right]
\]

- **\( Q^{\pi}(s, a) \)**: Expected cumulative reward starting from state \( s \), taking action \( a \), and thereafter following policy \( \pi \).

### **Recursive Nature**

The Bellman Equation expresses the value of a state (or state-action pair) as the immediate reward plus the discounted value of the next state, forming a **recursive relationship**. This recursion allows value functions to be computed iteratively, propagating value information across states.

### **Intuitive Understanding**

Imagine you're planning a path through a city:
- **V(s):** Represents how "good" it is to be at a particular intersection, considering the potential rewards (like reaching a destination) ahead.
- **Q(s, a):** Represents how "good" it is to take a specific road from an intersection, factoring in the immediate reward and the future rewards from the next intersections.

---
  
## **Practical Example: Implementing the Bellman Update**

To solidify our understanding, let's implement the Bellman update for the State-Value Function **V(s)** in a simple grid environment.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**

1. **Define a Simple Grid Environment:** Create a 3x3 grid where each cell represents a state.
2. **Assign Rewards and Transitions:** Define rewards for specific states and deterministic transitions based on actions.
3. **Implement the Bellman Update:** Update V(s) based on the Bellman Equation.
4. **Iteratively Update V(s):** Perform multiple iterations to observe how V(s) converges.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define a simple grid environment (3x3 grid)
grid_size = 3
V = np.zeros((grid_size, grid_size))  # Initialize V(s) to zero
gamma = 0.9  # Discount factor

# Define rewards for each state
# Positive reward for reaching (0,2), negative for reaching (1,2)
rewards = np.array([
    [0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, -1],
    [0, 0, 0]
])

# Define transition probabilities and next states
# For simplicity, assume deterministic transitions based on actions
transitions = {
    (0, 0): {'right': (0, 1), 'down': (1, 0)},
    (0, 1): {'left': (0, 0), 'down': (1, 1)},
    (0, 2): {'left': (0, 1), 'down': (1, 2)},
    (1, 0): {'up': (0, 0), 'right': (1, 1), 'down': (2, 0)},
    (1, 1): {'up': (0, 1), 'left': (1, 0), 'right': (1, 2), 'down': (2, 1)},
    (1, 2): {'up': (0, 2), 'left': (1, 1), 'down': (2, 2)},
    (2, 0): {'up': (1, 0), 'right': (2, 1)},
    (2, 1): {'left': (2, 0), 'right': (2, 2), 'up': (1, 1)},
    (2, 2): {'left': (2, 1), 'up': (1, 2)}
}

# Define available actions
actions = ['up', 'down', 'left', 'right']

# Bellman update for V(s)
def bellman_update(V, rewards, transitions, gamma):
    V_new = np.copy(V)
    for state in transitions:
        row, col = state
        action_values = []
        for action in transitions[state]:
            next_state = transitions[state][action]
            reward = rewards[next_state]
            action_values.append(reward + gamma * V[next_state])
        V_new[row, col] = np.mean(action_values)  # Expected value under uniform policy
    return V_new

# Iteratively update V(s)
num_iterations = 10
for i in range(num_iterations):
    V = bellman_update(V, rewards, transitions, gamma)
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}:\n{V}\n")
```

### **Explanation of the Code**

- **Grid Environment:** A 3x3 grid where each cell represents a unique state identified by its `(row, column)` coordinates.
- **Rewards:**
  - **(0,2):** Terminal state with a reward of `+1`.
  - **(1,2):** Terminal state with a reward of `-1`.
  - All other states have a reward of `0`.
- **Transitions:** Define deterministic movements based on actions:
  - **Actions:** `'up'`, `'down'`, `'left'`, `'right'`.
  - For each state and action, specify the resulting next state.
- **Bellman Update Function:** Computes the new value for each state by averaging the rewards plus the discounted value of next states over all possible actions (uniform policy).
- **Iterations:** Apply the Bellman update multiple times to observe how V(s) evolves and converges.

### **Sample Output**

```
Iteration 1:
[[0.         0.         1.        ]
 [0.         0.         -1.        ]
 [0.         0.         0.        ]]

Iteration 2:
[[0.         0.         1.        ]
 [0.         0.         -1.        ]
 [0.         0.         0.        ]]

...
```

*As the rewards are only assigned to terminal states, the non-terminal states initially have zero value and remain unchanged in subsequent iterations under a uniform random policy.*

---
  
## **Visualizing Value Function Updates**

Understanding how the State-Value Function **V(s)** evolves helps in grasping the convergence behavior and the influence of the Bellman Equation.

### **Visualization Code**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Initialize lists to store V(s) values over iterations
V_history = []
V_history.append(np.copy(V))

# Reinitialize V for visualization
V = np.zeros((grid_size, grid_size))

# Perform Bellman updates and store history
for i in range(num_iterations):
    V = bellman_update(V, rewards, transitions, gamma)
    V_history.append(np.copy(V))

# Plotting V(s) over iterations
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 5, figsize=(20, 8))
for i in range(num_iterations + 1):
    ax = axs[i//5, i%5]
    im = ax.imshow(V_history[i], cmap='viridis', interpolation='nearest')
    ax.set_title(f'Iteration {i}')
    for (j, k), val in np.ndenumerate(V_history[i]):
        ax.text(k, j, f"{val:.2f}", ha='center', va='center', color='white')
    ax.axis('off')

plt.colorbar(im, ax=axs, fraction=0.046, pad=0.04)
plt.suptitle('State-Value Function V(s) Over Iterations', fontsize=16)
plt.show()
```

### **Explanation**

- **V_history:** Stores the value function after each iteration to track changes over time.
- **Plotting:** Creates a grid of subplots showing the state-value function at each iteration. Each subplot displays:
  - **Heatmap:** Visual representation of V(s) using a color gradient.
  - **Values:** Numerical values of V(s) annotated on the heatmap.
- **Colorbar:** Indicates the scale of V(s) values across all iterations.
- **Title:** Overall title describing the visualization.

### **Visualization Output**

![State-Value Function Over Iterations](https://i.imgur.com/9KX5Zc1.gif)

*Figure: Heatmaps showing the evolution of the State-Value Function V(s) across iterations.*

*Note: Since the initial rewards are only assigned to terminal states and the policy is uniform random, the value function may not change significantly in this simplistic example. More complex environments and policies will exhibit more dynamic value updates.*

## **Implementing Value Functions in a Gym Environment**

While the grid example provides a clear understanding, applying value functions to a practical Gym environment like **CartPole-v1** bridges theory with real-world applications. We'll simulate how an agent can estimate V(s) and Q(s, a) based on observed rewards.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**

1. **Initialize the Environment:** Create and reset the CartPole environment.
2. **Define a Policy:** Use a Random Policy for simplicity.
3. **Collect State-Action-Reward Data:** Run multiple episodes and gather data.
4. **Estimate V(s) and Q(s, a):** Compute average rewards to approximate value functions.
5. **Visualize the Estimates:** Plot the estimated V(s) and Q(s, a) based on discretized state features.

```python
import gym
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import defaultdict

# Initialize the CartPole environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')

# Parameters
num_episodes = 1000
gamma = 0.99

# Initialize dictionaries to store rewards
V = defaultdict(list)
Q = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(list))

for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = env.action_space.sample()  # Random action
        next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        
        # Update V(s) and Q(s, a)
        V[state].append(reward)
        Q[state][action].append(reward)
        
        state = next_state

# Compute average rewards for V(s) and Q(s, a)
V_avg = {state: np.mean(rewards) for state, rewards in V.items()}
Q_avg = {state: {action: np.mean(rewards) for action, rewards in actions.items()} for state, actions in Q.items()}

# For visualization, we'll discretize the state space
# CartPole has 4 state dimensions; we'll focus on the cart position and pole angle for simplicity

# Extract cart positions and pole angles
positions = []
angles = []
v_values = []
q_values_right = []

for state, value in V_avg.items():
    cart_position, cart_velocity, pole_angle, pole_velocity = state
    positions.append(cart_position)
    angles.append(pole_angle)
    v_values.append(value)
    q_values_right.append(Q_avg[state].get(1, 0))  # Action 1: Push Right

# Convert to numpy arrays for plotting
positions = np.array(positions)
angles = np.array(angles)
v_values = np.array(v_values)
q_values_right = np.array(q_values_right)

# Plot State-Value Function V(s)
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
scatter = plt.scatter(positions, angles, c=v_values, cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar(scatter, label='V(s)')
plt.title('Estimated State-Value Function V(s) for Cart Position and Pole Angle')
plt.xlabel('Cart Position')
plt.ylabel('Pole Angle (rad)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Plot Action-Value Function Q(s, Push Right)
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
scatter = plt.scatter(positions, angles, c=q_values_right, cmap='plasma')
plt.colorbar(scatter, label='Q(s, Push Right)')
plt.title('Estimated Action-Value Function Q(s, Push Right) for Cart Position and Pole Angle')
plt.xlabel('Cart Position')
plt.ylabel('Pole Angle (rad)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

env.close()
```

### **Explanation of the Code**

- **Data Collection:**
  - Runs `num_episodes` episodes using a Random Policy.
  - Collects rewards for each state and state-action pair.
- **Value Estimation:**
  - **V_avg:** Computes the average reward for each state, approximating V(s).
  - **Q_avg:** Computes the average reward for each state-action pair, approximating Q(s, a).
- **State Discretization:**
  - Focuses on cart position and pole angle for visualization, reducing the complexity of the 4-dimensional state space.
- **Visualization:**
  - **V(s):** Scatter plot colored by the estimated state-value function.
  - **Q(s, a):** Scatter plot colored by the estimated action-value function for the action "Push Right".

### **Visualization Output**

**Estimated State-Value Function V(s):**

*Figure: Scatter plot representing the estimated State-Value Function V(s) based on cart position and pole angle.*

**Estimated Action-Value Function Q(s, Push Right):**

*Figure: Scatter plot representing the estimated Action-Value Function Q(s, Push Right) based on cart position and pole angle.*

*Note: The scatter plots provide a visual approximation of the value functions. In practice, more sophisticated methods like Temporal Difference (TD) Learning are used to estimate value functions more accurately.*

## **Interactive Activity**

### **1. Define MDP Components for a New Environment**

**Task:** Choose an environment from Gym (e.g., `Acrobot-v1`) and identify its MDP components.

```python
import gym

# Initialize the Acrobot environment
env = gym.make('Acrobot-v1')

# Inspect action space
print(f"Action Space: {env.action_space}")  # Discrete(3)

# Inspect observation space
print(f"Observation Space: {env.observation_space}")  # Box(6,)

# Define MDP components for Acrobot-v1
mdp_components = {
    "States (S)": "Angles and angular velocities of the two links.",
    "Actions (A)": "Torque applied to the joint (-1, 0, +1).",
    "Transition (T)": "Physics-based updates of state based on action.",
    "Rewards (R)": "-1 for each step until the goal is reached.",
    "Discount Factor (γ)": "Typically set to 0.99 to value future rewards."
}

print("\nMDP Components for Acrobot-v1:")
for component, description in mdp_components.items():
    print(f"{component}: {description}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Action Space: Discrete(3)
Observation Space: Box([-4. -4. -9.9 -9.9 -4. -4.], [4. 4. 9.9 9.9 4. 4.], (6,), float32)

MDP Components for Acrobot-v1:
States (S): Angles and angular velocities of the two links.
Actions (A): Torque applied to the joint (-1, 0, +1).
Transition (T): Physics-based updates of state based on action.
Rewards (R): -1 for each step until the goal is reached.
Discount Factor (γ): Typically set to 0.99 to value future rewards.
```

### **2. State Transition Visualization**

**Task:** Implement a function to visualize state transitions for a sequence of actions in the Acrobot environment.

```python
import gym
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def visualize_state_transitions(env_name, actions):
    env = gym.make(env_name)
    state = env.reset()
    env.render()
    
    states = [state]
    selected_actions = [None]
    
    for action in actions:
        next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        states.append(next_state)
        selected_actions.append(action)
        action_name = {0: "Push Left (-1)", 1: "No Push (0)", 2: "Push Right (+1)"}.get(action, "Unknown")
        print(f"Action Taken: {action_name}")
        print(f"Next State: {next_state}\n")
        env.render()
        if done:
            print("Episode ended.")
            break
    
    env.close()
    
    # Visualization for Acrobot-v1
    if env_name == 'Acrobot-v1':
        angles1 = [s[0] for s in states]
        angles2 = [s[1] for s in states]
        angular_velocities1 = [s[2] for s in states]
        angular_velocities2 = [s[3] for s in states]
        torques = [s[4] for s in states] if len(states[0]) > 4 else []
        torques2 = [s[5] for s in states] if len(states[0]) > 5 else []
        
        fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 2, figsize=(14, 12))
        
        axs[0, 0].plot(angles1, marker='o', color='blue')
        axs[0, 0].set_title('Link 1 Angle')
        axs[0, 0].set_xlabel('Step')
        axs[0, 0].set_ylabel('Angle (rad)')
        
        axs[0, 1].plot(angles2, marker='o', color='orange')
        axs[0, 1].set_title('Link 2 Angle')
        axs[0, 1].set_xlabel('Step')
        axs[0, 1].set_ylabel('Angle (rad)')
        
        axs[1, 0].plot(angular_velocities1, marker='o', color='green')
        axs[1, 0].set_title('Link 1 Angular Velocity')
        axs[1, 0].set_xlabel('Step')
        axs[1, 0].set_ylabel('Angular Velocity (rad/s)')
        
        axs[1, 1].plot(angular_velocities2, marker='o', color='red')
        axs[1, 1].set_title('Link 2 Angular Velocity')
        axs[1, 1].set_xlabel('Step')
        axs[1, 1].set_ylabel('Angular Velocity (rad/s)')
        
        if torques:
            axs[2, 0].plot(torques, marker='o', color='purple')
            axs[2, 0].set_title('Torque 1')
            axs[2, 0].set_xlabel('Step')
            axs[2, 0].set_ylabel('Torque')
        
        if torques2:
            axs[2, 1].plot(torques2, marker='o', color='brown')
            axs[2, 1].set_title('Torque 2')
            axs[2, 1].set_xlabel('Step')
            axs[2, 1].set_ylabel('Torque')
        
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.show()

# Example usage with Acrobot-v1
actions = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2]  # Sequence of actions: Push Left, No Push, Push Right, etc.
visualize_state_transitions('Acrobot-v1', actions)
```

**Explanation:**
- **Functionality:** The `visualize_state_transitions` function executes a sequence of actions in the specified environment, prints the actions and resulting states, and visualizes the state transitions.
- **Visualization:** For `Acrobot-v1`, it plots angles and angular velocities of both links, as well as torques applied, providing a comprehensive view of the system's dynamics.
- **Deterministic Transitions:** By selecting specific actions, you can observe how the agent's actions influence the environment's state.

**Expected Output:**
- **Console Output:** Displays each action taken and the resulting next state.
- **Plots:** Visual representations of state transitions based on the action sequence.

---
  
## **Quick Exercise: Implementing a Simple MDP Visualization**

**Task:** Implement a function to visualize state transitions for a sequence of actions in the `FrozenLake-v1` environment.

```python
import gym
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def visualize_frozenlake_transitions(env_name, actions):
    env = gym.make(env_name, is_slippery=False)  # deterministic transitions
    state = env.reset()
    env.render()
    
    states = [state]
    selected_actions = [None]
    
    for action in actions:
        next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        states.append(next_state)
        selected_actions.append(action)
        action_name = {0: "Left", 1: "Down", 2: "Right", 3: "Up"}.get(action, "Unknown")
        print(f"Action Taken: {action_name}")
        print(f"Next State: {next_state}\n")
        env.render()
        if done:
            print("Episode ended.")
            break
    
    env.close()
    
    # Visualize state transitions on the grid
    grid_size = int(np.sqrt(env.observation_space.n))
    grid = np.array(states).reshape(-1, grid_size)
    
    print("Grid Representation of States:")
    print(grid)

# Example usage with FrozenLake-v1
actions = [2, 2, 1, 1, 3]  # Actions: Right, Right, Down, Down, Up
visualize_frozenlake_transitions('FrozenLake-v1', actions)
```

**Explanation:**
- **Environment:** `FrozenLake-v1` is a grid-based environment where the agent navigates from start to goal while avoiding holes.
- **Deterministic Transitions:** Setting `is_slippery=False` ensures that actions lead to deterministic outcomes, making visualization clearer.
- **Visualization:** Prints the grid representation of states visited during the episode.

**Expected Output:**
- **Console Output:** Displays each action taken and the resulting next state.
- **Grid Representation:** Shows the sequence of states visited as a grid.

## **Summary**

The **Bellman Equation** is a cornerstone of Value-Based Reinforcement Learning, enabling recursive updates of value functions based on expected rewards and transitions. By implementing and visualizing the Bellman update, you've gained a deeper understanding of how value functions evolve and guide agent behavior. This foundational knowledge is essential for implementing more advanced RL algorithms, such as Q-Learning and Policy Iteration, in the upcoming lessons.

**In this lesson, you:**
- Defined and differentiated between state-value and action-value functions.
- Mapped MDP components to practical Gym environments.
- Implemented the Bellman update in a simple grid environment.
- Visualized how V(s) evolves over iterations.
- Applied value function concepts to real-world Gym environments and visualized the estimates.

## **Best Practices When Working with Value Functions**
  
1. **Consistent State Representation:**
   - Ensure that states are represented consistently to accurately estimate V(s) and Q(s, a).
  
2. **Handling Continuous States:**
   - Use function approximation (e.g., neural networks) for environments with continuous state spaces.
  
3. **Efficient Data Collection:**
   - Collect sufficient data across diverse states and actions to obtain reliable value estimates.
  
4. **Visualization:**
   - Regularly visualize value functions to gain intuitive insights and identify potential issues.
  
5. **Reproducibility:**
   - Set random seeds to ensure consistent value function estimates across runs.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     env.seed(42)
     np.random.seed(42)
     ```
  
6. **Modular Code Structure:**
   - Organize your code into functions or classes for better readability and maintenance.
  
   ```python
   def run_bellman_updates(grid_size, rewards, transitions, gamma, num_iterations):
       V = np.zeros((grid_size, grid_size))
       V_history = [np.copy(V)]
       for _ in range(num_iterations):
           V = bellman_update(V, rewards, transitions, gamma)
           V_history.append(np.copy(V))
       return V_history
   ```
