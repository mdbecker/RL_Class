## **Lesson 1.3: Setting Up Your Python Environment**

### **Learning Objectives**
- **Set up a Python development environment** tailored for Reinforcement Learning.
- **Install and configure necessary libraries** such as OpenAI Gym, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Stable Baselines3.
- **Ensure a smooth workflow** for implementing and running RL algorithms.
- **Troubleshoot common installation issues** to maintain a stable development setup.
- **Understand the importance of environment management** in machine learning projects.

### **Description**
Before diving into coding Reinforcement Learning algorithms, it's essential to set up your Python environment correctly. This lesson will guide you through creating a fresh Conda environment and installing all the necessary packages. We'll also verify the installation to ensure everything is working smoothly. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a robust development environment ready for hands-on RL projects.

### **Why Use Conda for Environment Management?**
Conda is a powerful package and environment management system that allows you to create isolated environments with specific dependencies. This isolation ensures that your RL projects remain unaffected by changes in other projects or system-wide packages.

- **Isolation:** Prevents conflicts between package versions.
- **Reproducibility:** Makes it easier to replicate environments across different machines.
- **Flexibility:** Supports both Python and non-Python packages.

### **Step 1: Install Anaconda or Miniconda**
If you haven't installed Conda yet, download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) based on your preference.

- **Anaconda:** Comes with a large collection of pre-installed packages, suitable for beginners.
- **Miniconda:** A minimal installer with only Conda and its dependencies, allowing you to install only the packages you need.

**Download Links:**
- [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
- [Miniconda Installation](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

*After installation, ensure that Conda is added to your system's PATH.*

### **Step 2: Create a New Conda Environment**
We'll create a new environment named `rl_course` with Python 3.10. This ensures compatibility with the latest RL libraries.

```bash
# Create a new Conda environment named 'rl_course' with Python 3.10
conda create -n rl_course python=3.10 -y
```

*The `-y` flag automatically confirms the installation of required packages.*

### **Step 3: Activate the Environment**

```bash
# Activate the 'rl_course' environment
conda activate rl_course
```

*After activation, your terminal prompt should reflect the active environment, e.g., `(rl_course) $`.*

### **Step 4: Install Essential Packages**
We'll install essential packages for RL, including JupyterLab, NumPy, Matplotlib, and other scientific computing libraries.

```bash
# Install JupyterLab, NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy using Conda
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab numpy matplotlib scipy -y
```

### **Step 5: Install Additional RL Libraries**
Some RL libraries are better installed via `pip`. We'll install `gym`, `stable-baselines3`, and other useful packages.

```bash
# Install OpenAI Gym and Stable Baselines3 using pip
pip install gym
pip install stable-baselines3
```

*Note: Installing `stable-baselines3` via `pip` ensures you get the latest version with all dependencies.*

### **Step 6: Verify the Installation**
Let's ensure that all packages are installed correctly by importing them in Python.

```python
# Open a Python shell or Jupyter Notebook and run the following:

import gym
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import stable_baselines3

print("All packages are installed correctly!")
```

### **Expected Output**
```
All packages are installed correctly!
```

### **Step 7: Launch JupyterLab**
Start JupyterLab to begin working on your RL projects.

```bash
# Launch JupyterLab
jupyter lab
```

*JupyterLab will open in your default web browser, providing an interactive environment for coding and visualization.*

### **Troubleshooting Tips**
- **Conda Activation Issues:** If you encounter issues activating the Conda environment, ensure that Conda is properly installed and initialized in your shell.
  
  ```bash
  # Initialize Conda for your shell (e.g., bash, zsh)
  conda init bash
  # Restart your terminal after running the above command
  ```

- **Package Installation Errors:** If a package fails to install, try updating Conda and pip:
  
  ```bash
  # Update Conda
  conda update conda -y
  
  # Upgrade pip
  pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

- **Environment Not Found:** Ensure you've activated the correct environment with `conda activate rl_course`. If the environment doesn't exist, recreate it using Step 2.

- **JupyterLab Not Launching:** If JupyterLab doesn't launch, try reinstalling it:
  
  ```bash
  conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab -y
  ```

### **Interactive Activity**
1. **Environment Check:** In JupyterLab, create a new notebook and run the verification code to confirm all packages are installed.

    ```python
    import gym
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import stable_baselines3
    
    print("All packages are installed correctly!")
    ```

2. **Basic Plotting:** Test Matplotlib by creating a simple plot to ensure it's working correctly.

    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
    y = np.sin(x)

    plt.plot(x, y)
    plt.title("Sine Wave")
    plt.xlabel("x")
    plt.ylabel("sin(x)")
    plt.show()
    ```

    *You should see a sine wave plot displayed.*

3. **Gym Environment Test:** Verify that Gym is functioning by resetting an environment and rendering it.

    ```python
    import gym

    # Initialize the CartPole environment
    env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
    state = env.reset()
    
    # Render the initial state
    env.render()
    
    # Close the environment
    env.close()
    ```

    *A window displaying the CartPole environment should appear briefly.*

### **Best Practices for Environment Management**
- **Naming Conventions:** Use descriptive names for your environments, e.g., `rl_course`, `rl_project_x`.
- **Version Control:** Keep track of package versions using `conda list` or `pip freeze > requirements.txt` for reproducibility.
- **Environment Backup:** Export your environment configuration to recreate it easily.

    ```bash
    # Export Conda environment to a YAML file
    conda env export > rl_course_env.yaml
    ```

    *To recreate the environment on another machine:*

    ```bash
    conda env create -f rl_course_env.yaml
    ```

### **Quick Exercise: Create and Test Your Environment**
1. **Create a new environment:** Follow Steps 2 and 3 to create and activate a new Conda environment named `rl_test`.
2. **Install Packages:** Install the essential and additional RL libraries as outlined in Steps 4 and 5.
3. **Verify Installation:** Run the verification code in a Jupyter notebook to ensure all packages are installed correctly.
4. **Plot a Graph:** Create a simple Matplotlib plot to test visualization capabilities.
5. **Run Gym Environment:** Initialize and render the CartPole environment to confirm Gym is operational.

### **Summary**
You've successfully set up your Python environment for Reinforcement Learning! By using Conda, you've ensured that your project dependencies are isolated and manageable. With essential libraries like OpenAI Gym, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Stable Baselines3 installed, you're now ready to start implementing RL algorithms and diving into hands-on projects.
