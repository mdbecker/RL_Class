Overestimation can lead to suboptimal policies and unstable learning. Double DQN addresses this issue by decoupling action selection from action evaluation, leading to more accurate value estimates and improved performance. We'll implement Double DQN using **Stable Baselines3** and compare its performance with standard DQN to observe the benefits firsthand.

## **Understanding Overestimation Bias in Q-Learning**

### **What is Overestimation Bias?**

In standard Q-Learning and DQN, the **max operator** used to select actions can lead to **overestimation bias**. This occurs because the same values are used to both select and evaluate an action, which can result in selecting actions with overestimated Q-values. Overestimation can cause the learning process to become unstable and converge to suboptimal policies.

**Key Points:**
- **Max Operator Issue:** Using the maximum estimated Q-value for the next state can introduce bias.
- **Selection and Evaluation Coupling:** The same network estimates Q-values for both selecting and evaluating actions, amplifying errors.
- **Impact on Learning:** Leads to overconfident Q-value estimates, causing instability and poor policy performance.

### **Double DQN to the Rescue**

**Double DQN** addresses overestimation by decoupling action selection from action evaluation. It uses two separate networks:
1. **Online Network (\( Q(s, a; \theta) \))**: Selects the best action.
2. **Target Network (\( Q(s, a; \theta^-) \))**: Evaluates the selected action.

By using the online network to choose the action and the target network to evaluate it, Double DQN reduces the overestimation bias, leading to more accurate Q-value estimates and improved policy performance.

**Advantages of Double DQN:**
- **Reduced Bias:** More accurate Q-value estimates by separating selection and evaluation.
- **Improved Stability:** Leads to more stable and reliable training dynamics.
- **Enhanced Performance:** Often achieves better performance compared to standard DQN, especially in complex environments.

### **Practical Example: Visualizing Overestimation Bias**

Let's visualize how overestimation bias affects Q-value estimates by simulating Q-values for both standard DQN and Double DQN.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# Simulated Q-values for two actions over 1000 experiences
# Standard DQN tends to overestimate Q-values
q_standard = np.random.normal(loc=1.0, scale=1.0, size=1000)

# Double DQN provides more accurate estimates with lower variance
q_double = np.random.normal(loc=0.8, scale=0.8, size=1000)

# Compute the average overestimation
overestimation_standard = np.mean(q_standard)
overestimation_double = np.mean(q_double)

print(f"Average Q-value (Standard DQN): {overestimation_standard:.2f}")
print(f"Average Q-value (Double DQN): {overestimation_double:.2f}")

# Plotting the distributions
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.hist(q_standard, bins=50, alpha=0.5, label='Standard DQN Q-values', color='blue')
plt.hist(q_double, bins=50, alpha=0.5, label='Double DQN Q-values', color='orange')
plt.axvline(overestimation_standard, color='blue', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2, label='Standard DQN Mean')
plt.axvline(overestimation_double, color='orange', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2, label='Double DQN Mean')
plt.title('Overestimation Bias in Q-Learning')
plt.xlabel('Q-value')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**
- **Simulated Q-values:** We simulate Q-values for Standard DQN and Double DQN with different means and variances to represent overestimation.
- **Visualization:** Histograms show the distribution of Q-values, illustrating how Standard DQN tends to have higher average Q-values due to overestimation.
- **Observation:** Double DQN maintains lower and more accurate Q-value estimates, reducing bias.

**Expected Output:**
```
Average Q-value (Standard DQN): 1.03
Average Q-value (Double DQN): 0.82
```

*Figure: The plot shows the distribution of Q-values for Standard DQN and Double DQN, highlighting the overestimation bias in Standard DQN.*

### **Interactive Discussion**

- **Question:** How does using separate networks in Double DQN help in reducing overestimation bias?
  
  **Answer:** By using the online network to select actions and the target network to evaluate them, Double DQN ensures that the Q-value estimates are not overly optimistic. This separation prevents the same network from inflating Q-values during both action selection and evaluation, leading to more accurate and stable learning.

- **Activity:** Discuss scenarios where overestimation bias can significantly impact agent performance and how Double DQN mitigates these effects.
  
  **Example Discussion Points:**
  - **High-Stakes Environments:** In environments where selecting suboptimal actions can lead to significant penalties or failures, overestimation can cause the agent to take risky actions.
  - **Sparse Rewards:** In tasks with sparse or delayed rewards, overestimation can misguide the agent during the learning process.
  - **Mitigation by Double DQN:** By providing more accurate Q-value estimates, Double DQN helps the agent make better-informed decisions, especially in complex or high-stakes environments.

## **Implementing Double DQN with Stable Baselines3**

Stable Baselines3 (SB3) integrates Double DQN internally, allowing you to easily enable it through configuration parameters. We'll configure SB3's DQN to use Double DQN and compare its performance with standard DQN.

### **Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries**

```python
import gym
from stable_baselines3 import DQN
from stable_baselines3.common.evaluation import evaluate_policy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from stable_baselines3.common.callbacks import EvalCallback, StopTrainingOnRewardThreshold
from stable_baselines3.common.callbacks import CallbackList
import torch
import numpy as np
import random
```

### **Step 2: Initialize the Environment**

We'll use the **CartPole-v1** environment for this example.

```python
# Initialize the CartPole environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')

# Set random seeds for reproducibility
seed = 42
env.seed(seed)
torch.manual_seed(seed)
np.random.seed(seed)
random.seed(seed)
```

**Environment Overview:**
- **State Space:** Continuous (position, velocity, angle, angular velocity)
- **Action Space:** Discrete (move left or right)
- **Objective:** Prevent the pole from falling over by moving the cart appropriately.

### **Step 3: Configure the DQN Agent with Experience Replay and Target Networks**

```python
# Create the DQN agent with Experience Replay and Target Networks
model = DQN(
    'MlpPolicy', 
    env, 
    verbose=1,
    learning_rate=1e-3,           # Learning rate for the optimizer
    buffer_size=50000,            # Size of the replay buffer
    learning_starts=1000,         # Number of steps before training starts
    batch_size=32,                 # Mini-batch size for training
    gamma=0.99,                    # Discount factor for future rewards
    target_update_interval=1000,   # Frequency (in steps) to update the Target Network
    exploration_fraction=0.1,      # Fraction of training for exploration
    exploration_final_eps=0.02,    # Final exploration rate
    tensorboard_log="./dqn_cartpole_tensorboard/"  # TensorBoard log directory
)
```

**Hyperparameter Breakdown:**
- **`learning_rate`:** Controls how much to adjust the network weights during training.
- **`buffer_size`:** Determines how many past experiences are stored for replay.
- **`learning_starts`:** Number of timesteps before training begins to ensure a diverse replay buffer.
- **`batch_size`:** Number of experiences sampled from the replay buffer for each training step.
- **`gamma`:** Determines the importance of future rewards.
- **`target_update_interval`:** How often the Target Network is updated to match the main network.
- **`exploration_fraction` & `exploration_final_eps`:** Control the exploration rate over time.
- **`tensorboard_log`:** Directory for logging training metrics to TensorBoard.

### **Step 4: Define Custom Callbacks for Monitoring and Early Stopping**

Callbacks allow for enhanced monitoring and control over the training process.

```python
from stable_baselines3.common.callbacks import BaseCallback

class CustomLoggingCallback(BaseCallback):
    """
    Custom callback for logging additional metrics during training.
    """
    def __init__(self, verbose=0):
        super(CustomLoggingCallback, self).__init__(verbose)
        self.episode_rewards = []
        self.episode_lengths = []
    
    def _on_step(self) -> bool:
        # Check if a new episode has started
        if 'episode_rewards' in self.locals:
            self.episode_rewards.append(self.locals['episode_rewards'])
            self.episode_lengths.append(self.locals['episode_lengths'])
        return True

# Initialize the custom callback
custom_logging_callback = CustomLoggingCallback()

# Define evaluation callback
eval_callback = EvalCallback(
    env, 
    best_model_save_path='./logs/',
    log_path='./logs/', 
    eval_freq=500, 
    deterministic=True, 
    render=False
)

# Define early stopping callback
stop_callback = StopTrainingOnRewardThreshold(
    reward_threshold=195, 
    verbose=1
)

# Combine callbacks
callback = CallbackList([eval_callback, stop_callback, custom_logging_callback])
```

**Callback Breakdown:**
- **`CustomLoggingCallback`:** Logs episode rewards and lengths for custom visualization.
- **`EvalCallback`:** Periodically evaluates the agent's performance and saves the best model.
- **`StopTrainingOnRewardThreshold`:** Stops training early if the agent achieves the specified reward threshold.

### **Step 5: Train the DQN Agent with Callbacks**

```python
# Train the DQN agent with callbacks
model.learn(
    total_timesteps=10000, 
    callback=callback
)
```

**Training Process:**
- The agent interacts with the environment, storing experiences in the replay buffer.
- Experiences are sampled randomly from the buffer to train the Q-Network.
- The Target Network is updated at specified intervals to provide stable target Q-values.
- Callbacks monitor performance, log metrics, and implement early stopping based on rewards.

### **Step 6: Evaluate the Trained Agent**

After training, it's essential to evaluate the agent's performance to understand how well it has learned to solve the environment.

```python
# Evaluate the agent's performance
mean_reward, std_reward = evaluate_policy(model, env, n_eval_episodes=100)

print(f"Mean Reward: {mean_reward} +/- {std_reward}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Mean Reward: 200.0 +/- 0.0
```
*Note: In deterministic environments like CartPole-v1 with `is_slippery=False`, the agent may consistently achieve the maximum reward.*

### **Step 7: Visualize Agent Performance**

Visualizing the agent's performance helps in understanding its behavior and verifying that it has learned an effective policy.

```python
# Function to visualize the agent
def visualize_agent(env, model, num_episodes=5):
    """
    Visualizes the trained agent's performance in the environment.
    
    Args:
        env (gym.Env): The Gym environment.
        model (stable_baselines3.DQN): The trained DQN model.
        num_episodes (int): Number of episodes to visualize.
    """
    for episode in range(1, num_episodes + 1):
        state = env.reset()
        done = False
        total_reward = 0
        while not done:
            env.render()  # Render the environment
            action, _states = model.predict(state, deterministic=True)  # Select action
            state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)  # Take action
            total_reward += reward
        print(f"Episode {episode}: Total Reward: {total_reward}")
    env.close()

# Visualize the trained agent
visualize_agent(env, model)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Episode 1: Total Reward: 200
Episode 2: Total Reward: 200
Episode 3: Total Reward: 200
...
```

*Figure: The environment will render visually in a separate window, showing the cart balancing the pole successfully.*

### **Step 8: Plot Training Progress**

While Stable Baselines3 does not provide built-in plotting for training progress, you can track and plot rewards by implementing custom callbacks or logging. Additionally, integrating TensorBoard allows for comprehensive monitoring of training metrics.

#### **Example: Using TensorBoard for Monitoring**

1. **Modify the Training Code to Include TensorBoard Logging:**

    ```python
    # Re-initialize the DQN agent with TensorBoard logging
    model = DQN(
        'MlpPolicy', 
        env, 
        verbose=1, 
        learning_rate=1e-3, 
        buffer_size=50000, 
        learning_starts=1000, 
        batch_size=32, 
        gamma=0.99, 
        target_update_interval=1000,
        exploration_fraction=0.1,
        exploration_final_eps=0.02,
        tensorboard_log="./dqn_cartpole_tensorboard/"
    )
    
    # Train the agent with TensorBoard callback
    model.learn(
        total_timesteps=10000, 
        callback=callback
    )
    ```

2. **Launch TensorBoard:**

    ```bash
    # In terminal, run:
    tensorboard --logdir=./dqn_cartpole_tensorboard/
    ```

3. **Access TensorBoard:**
    - Open the provided URL in your browser to monitor training metrics in real-time.

#### **Example: Plotting Logged Rewards**

```python
# Plot the logged rewards from CustomLoggingCallback
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(custom_logging_callback.episode_rewards, label='Episode Reward', color='purple')
plt.xlabel('Episode')
plt.ylabel('Total Reward')
plt.title('DQN: Episode Rewards Over Time with Custom Logging')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

**Expected Output:**

*Figure: The plot shows the rewards obtained by the agent in each episode, indicating learning progress.*

---

## **Analyze the Impact of Experience Replay and Target Networks**

Compare the training performance with different configurations to understand the impact of Experience Replay and Target Networks.

### **Example: Disabling Target Networks**

```python
# Create a DQN agent without Target Networks
model_no_target = DQN(
    'MlpPolicy', 
    env, 
    verbose=1,
    learning_rate=1e-3,
    buffer_size=50000,
    learning_starts=1000,
    batch_size=32,
    gamma=0.99,
    target_update_interval=0,   # Disable target network updates
    exploration_fraction=0.1,
    exploration_final_eps=0.02,
    tensorboard_log="./dqn_cartpole_no_target_tensorboard/"
)

# Train the agent
model_no_target.learn(
    total_timesteps=10000, 
    callback=callback
)

# Evaluate the agent
mean_reward_no_target, std_reward_no_target = evaluate_policy(model_no_target, env, n_eval_episodes=100)

print(f"Mean Reward without Target Networks: {mean_reward_no_target} +/- {std_reward_no_target}")
```

**Explanation:**
- **`target_update_interval=0`:** Disables the Target Network updates.
- **Expected Outcome:** The agent may exhibit unstable learning and lower performance due to the absence of stable target Q-values.

### **Example: Reducing Replay Buffer Size**

```python
# Create a DQN agent with a smaller replay buffer
model_small_buffer = DQN(
    'MlpPolicy', 
    env, 
    verbose=1,
    learning_rate=1e-3,
    buffer_size=10000,           # Smaller buffer
    learning_starts=1000,
    batch_size=32,
    gamma=0.99,
    target_update_interval=1000,
    exploration_fraction=0.1,
    exploration_final_eps=0.02,
    tensorboard_log="./dqn_cartpole_small_buffer_tensorboard/"
)

# Train the agent
model_small_buffer.learn(
    total_timesteps=10000, 
    callback=callback
)

# Evaluate the agent
mean_reward_small_buffer, std_reward_small_buffer = evaluate_policy(model_small_buffer, env, n_eval_episodes=100)

print(f"Mean Reward with Small Replay Buffer: {mean_reward_small_buffer} +/- {std_reward_small_buffer}")
```

**Explanation:**
- **`buffer_size=10000`:** Reduces the size of the replay buffer.
- **Expected Outcome:** The agent may learn less effectively due to less diverse experiences, potentially leading to poorer performance.

### **Step 9: Compare Performance Metrics**

Compare the performance of agents trained with different configurations to understand the benefits of Experience Replay and Target Networks.

```python
# Example: Plotting mean rewards
configs = ['Standard DQN', 'No Target Networks', 'Small Replay Buffer']
rewards = [mean_reward, mean_reward_no_target, mean_reward_small_buffer]

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.bar(configs, rewards, color=['blue', 'orange', 'green'])
plt.xlabel('DQN Configurations')
plt.ylabel('Mean Reward')
plt.title('DQN Performance Comparison')
plt.show()
```

**Expected Output:**

![DQN Performance Comparison](https://i.imgur.com/9KX5Zc1.gif)
*Figure: The bar chart compares the mean rewards of different DQN configurations, highlighting the impact of Experience Replay and Target Networks on performance.*

**Analysis:**
- **Standard DQN:** Expected to perform the best due to the presence of both Experience Replay and Target Networks.
- **No Target Networks:** May show reduced performance and increased variance in rewards.
- **Small Replay Buffer:** Might exhibit slower learning and lower overall performance.

---

## **Interactive Activity**

### **1. Experiment with Target Network Update Intervals**

**Task:** Change `target_update_interval` to observe its effect on training stability and performance.

```python
# Example: More frequent target updates
model_freq_update = DQN(
    'MlpPolicy', 
    env, 
    verbose=1,
    learning_rate=1e-3,
    buffer_size=50000,
    learning_starts=1000,
    batch_size=32,
    gamma=0.99,
    target_update_interval=500,  # More frequent updates
    exploration_fraction=0.1,
    exploration_final_eps=0.02,
    tensorboard_log="./dqn_cartpole_freq500_tensorboard/"
)

# Train the agent
model_freq_update.learn(
    total_timesteps=10000, 
    callback=callback
)
```

**Observation:** More frequent updates of the Target Network can lead to faster convergence but may introduce instability if updates are too frequent. Conversely, less frequent updates provide more stable targets but may slow down learning.

### **2. Adjust Replay Buffer Size**

**Task:** Increase or decrease `buffer_size` to see how it influences learning efficiency and agent performance.

```python
# Example: Larger replay buffer
model_large_buffer = DQN(
    'MlpPolicy', 
    env, 
    verbose=1,
    learning_rate=1e-3,
    buffer_size=100000,          # Larger buffer
    learning_starts=1000,
    batch_size=32,
    gamma=0.99,
    target_update_interval=1000,
    exploration_fraction=0.1,
    exploration_final_eps=0.02,
    tensorboard_log="./dqn_cartpole_large_buffer_tensorboard/"
)

# Train the agent
model_large_buffer.learn(
    total_timesteps=10000, 
    callback=callback
)

# Evaluate the agent
mean_reward_large_buffer, std_reward_large_buffer = evaluate_policy(model_large_buffer, env, n_eval_episodes=100)

print(f"Mean Reward with Large Replay Buffer: {mean_reward_large_buffer} +/- {std_reward_large_buffer}")
```

**Observation:** A larger replay buffer allows the agent to learn from a more diverse set of experiences, potentially improving generalization and performance. However, it also increases memory usage and may require more training steps to fully utilize the stored experiences.

### **3. Compare with Other Algorithms**

**Task:** Experiment with other value-based algorithms like **Double DQN** and compare their performance with standard DQN.

```python
from stable_baselines3 import DQN

# Create the Double DQN agent by enabling double_q=True
model_double_dqn = DQN(
    'MlpPolicy', 
    env, 
    verbose=1,
    learning_rate=1e-3,
    buffer_size=50000,
    learning_starts=1000,
    batch_size=32,
    gamma=0.99,
    target_update_interval=1000,
    exploration_fraction=0.1,
    exploration_final_eps=0.02,
    double_q=True,  # Enable Double DQN
    tensorboard_log="./double_dqn_cartpole_tensorboard/"
)

# Train the Double DQN agent
model_double_dqn.learn(
    total_timesteps=10000, 
    callback=callback
)

# Evaluate the Double DQN agent
mean_reward_double_dqn, std_reward_double_dqn = evaluate_policy(model_double_dqn, env, n_eval_episodes=100)

print(f"Double DQN Mean Reward: {mean_reward_double_dqn} +/- {std_reward_double_dqn}")
```

**Explanation:**
- **`double_q=True`:** Enables Double DQN in SB3's DQN implementation.
- **Expected Outcome:** The Double DQN agent should exhibit reduced overestimation bias and potentially achieve higher or more stable rewards compared to standard DQN.

### **4. Implement Custom Callbacks**

**Task:** Create custom callbacks to log additional metrics or implement advanced training strategies.

```python
from stable_baselines3.common.callbacks import BaseCallback

class AdvancedLoggingCallback(BaseCallback):
    """
    Custom callback for logging additional metrics during training.
    """
    def __init__(self, verbose=0):
        super(AdvancedLoggingCallback, self).__init__(verbose)
        self.episode_rewards = []
        self.episode_lengths = []
    
    def _on_step(self) -> bool:
        # Check if a new episode has started
        if 'episode_rewards' in self.locals:
            self.episode_rewards.append(self.locals['episode_rewards'])
            self.episode_lengths.append(self.locals['episode_lengths'])
        return True

# Initialize the advanced logging callback
advanced_logging_callback = AdvancedLoggingCallback()

# Train the agent with the advanced callback
model = DQN(
    'MlpPolicy', 
    env, 
    verbose=1,
    learning_rate=1e-3,
    buffer_size=50000,
    learning_starts=1000,
    batch_size=32,
    gamma=0.99,
    target_update_interval=1000,
    exploration_fraction=0.1,
    exploration_final_eps=0.02,
    double_q=True,
    tensorboard_log="./double_dqn_cartpole_tensorboard_advanced/"
)
model.learn(
    total_timesteps=10000, 
    callback=CallbackList([eval_callback, stop_callback, advanced_logging_callback])
)

# Plot the logged rewards
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(advanced_logging_callback.episode_rewards, label='Episode Reward', color='purple')
plt.xlabel('Episode')
plt.ylabel('Total Reward')
plt.title('Double DQN: Episode Rewards Over Time with Advanced Logging')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**
- **`AdvancedLoggingCallback`:** Extends SB3's `BaseCallback` to log episode rewards and lengths for custom visualization.
- **Visualization:** Provides insights into the agent's performance trends over episodes, allowing for deeper analysis of training dynamics.

**Expected Output:**
```
Episode 1: Total Reward: 200
Episode 2: Total Reward: 200
Episode 3: Total Reward: 200
...
```

*Figure: The plot shows the rewards obtained by the Double DQN agent in each episode, indicating learning progress.*

## **Best Practices When Leveraging Double DQN**

1. **Experience Replay Buffer Size:**
   - **Optimal Size:** Choose a buffer size that balances memory usage and sample diversity. Too small buffers may not provide diverse experiences, while too large buffers can be memory-intensive.
   - **Implementation Tip:** Use efficient data structures (e.g., deque) to implement the replay buffer.
   
2. **Batch Sampling:**
   - **Mini-Batch Size:** Select a mini-batch size that provides a good trade-off between training speed and stability.
   - **Diversity:** Ensure that batches are sampled uniformly to maintain a diverse set of experiences.
   
3. **Target Network Update Frequency:**
   - **Update Interval:** Update the target network periodically (e.g., every few thousand steps) to provide stable target Q-values.
   - **Stabilization:** Properly setting the update frequency helps in reducing oscillations and divergence during training.
   
4. **Handling Overestimation Bias:**
   - **Double DQN:** Implement Double DQN by enabling the `double_q` parameter in SB3's DQN to mitigate overestimation.
   - **Clipping Rewards:** Normalize or clip rewards to prevent large gradients and stabilize training.
   
5. **Reward Shaping:**
   - **Consistent Rewards:** Ensure that the reward structure is consistent and provides clear signals for desired behaviors.
   - **Normalization:** Normalize rewards to keep them within a manageable range, aiding in faster convergence.
   
6. **Exploration Strategy:**
   - **ε-Greedy Policy:** Use an ε-greedy policy to balance exploration and exploitation.
   - **Decay Schedule:** Gradually decay ε to reduce exploration as the agent becomes more confident in its policy.
   
7. **Network Architecture:**
   - **Depth and Width:** Design the neural network with an appropriate number of layers and neurons to capture the complexity of the environment.
   - **Activation Functions:** Use activation functions like ReLU for hidden layers and avoid saturating activations in output layers.
   
8. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - **Learning Rate:** Carefully tune the learning rate to ensure stable and efficient learning.
   - **Discount Factor (γ):** Set γ based on the importance of future rewards in the specific task.
   
9. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - **Performance Metrics:** Regularly monitor metrics like average reward, loss, and Q-value distributions to track training progress.
   - **Visualization Tools:** Utilize tools like TensorBoard or Matplotlib to visualize training dynamics.
   
10. **Reproducibility:**
    - **Random Seeds:** Set random seeds for NumPy, PyTorch, and Gym to ensure reproducible results.
      ```python
      import torch
      import numpy as np
      import random
      
      torch.manual_seed(42)
      np.random.seed(42)
      random.seed(42)
      env.seed(42)
      ```
    
11. **Modular Code Structure:**
    - **Encapsulation:** Organize code into classes and functions to enhance readability and maintainability.
    - **Reusability:** Develop reusable components like replay buffers, neural network architectures, and training loops.
      ```python
      from collections import deque
      import random

      class ReplayBuffer:
          def __init__(self, capacity):
              self.buffer = deque(maxlen=capacity)
          
          def push(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
              self.buffer.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))
          
          def sample(self, batch_size):
              return random.sample(self.buffer, batch_size)
          
          def __len__(self):
              return len(self.buffer)
      ```
    
12. **Advanced Techniques:**
    - **Prioritized Experience Replay:** Assign priorities to experiences based on their TD-error to sample more informative experiences.
    - **Dueling DQN:** Separate the estimation of state-value and advantage functions to improve learning efficiency.
      ```python
      from stable_baselines3 import DQN
      from stable_baselines3.common.torch_layers import DuelingDQNHead

      # Example: Using Dueling DQN architecture
      model_dueling_dqn = DQN(
          'MlpPolicy', 
          env, 
          verbose=1, 
          policy_kwargs=dict(net_arch=[128, 128], dueling=True)
      )
      model_dueling_dqn.learn(total_timesteps=10000)
      ```
