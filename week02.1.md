## **Setting Up the Environment**

Before we begin exploring Gym environments, ensure your Python environment is properly set up. While Lesson 1.3 covered the initial setup, we'll proceed under the assumption that you're continuing in the same Conda environment (`rl_course`). If you prefer creating a new environment for Week 2, follow the steps below.

### **Step 1: (Optional) Create a New Conda Environment**

*Note: This step is optional. You can continue using the `rl_course` environment created in Lesson 1.3.*

```bash
# Create a new Conda environment named 'rl_course_week2' with Python 3.10
conda create -n rl_course_week2 python=3.10 -y
```

### **Step 2: Activate the Environment**

```bash
# Activate the 'rl_course_week2' environment
conda activate rl_course_week2
```

*If you skipped Step 1, activate your existing environment:*

```bash
conda activate rl_course
```

### **Step 3: Install Essential Packages**

Ensure that you have the latest versions of essential packages installed.

```bash
# Install JupyterLab, NumPy, and Matplotlib using Conda
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab numpy matplotlib -y
```

### **Step 4: Install OpenAI Gym and Additional Libraries**

```bash
# Install OpenAI Gym using pip
pip install gym

# Install Stable Baselines3 for advanced RL algorithms (optional for this lesson)
pip install stable-baselines3
```

*If you plan to work with specific environments like Atari or MuJoCo, additional installations may be required. Refer to the [OpenAI Gym documentation](https://gym.openai.com/docs/) for detailed instructions.*

### **Step 5: Launch JupyterLab**

```bash
# Launch JupyterLab
jupyter lab
```

*JupyterLab will open in your default web browser, providing an interactive environment for coding and visualization.*

## **Exploring OpenAI Gym Environments**

### **What is OpenAI Gym?**

OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It provides a standardized API to communicate between the agent and the environment, facilitating the development of RL solutions across a variety of tasks.

**Key Features:**
- **Standardized Interface:** Consistent methods (`reset`, `step`, `render`, etc.) across all environments.
- **Diverse Environments:** Includes classic control tasks, Atari games, robotic simulations, and more.
- **Extensibility:** Ability to create custom environments tailored to specific needs.
- **Community and Support:** Active community contributing to a growing list of environments and resources.

### **Key Gym Environment APIs**

Understanding the core APIs is crucial for interacting effectively with Gym environments.

1. **`reset()`**
   - **Purpose:** Resets the environment to its initial state and returns that state.
   - **Usage:** Typically called at the beginning of an episode.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     state = env.reset()
     ```

2. **`step(action)`**
   - **Purpose:** Takes an action as input and returns four values: next state, reward, done flag, and additional info.
   - **Usage:** Called iteratively to interact with the environment.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
     ```

3. **`render()`**
   - **Purpose:** Renders the current state of the environment.
   - **Usage:** Useful for visualizing agent behavior.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     env.render()
     ```

4. **`action_space` and `observation_space`**
   - **Purpose:** Define the structure of actions and observations.
   - **Usage:** Useful for understanding what actions are possible and what observations to expect.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     print(env.action_space)
     print(env.observation_space)
     ```

### **Understanding Action and Observation Spaces**

Before interacting with an environment, it's essential to understand its action and observation spaces.

- **Action Space:** Defines the set of possible actions an agent can take.
  - **Discrete:** A finite set of actions (e.g., `{0, 1}`).
  - **Box:** A continuous range of actions (e.g., steering angles).

- **Observation Space:** Defines the format of the environment's state.
  - **Discrete:** A finite set of states.
  - **Box:** Continuous values representing various state variables.

**Example: Inspecting CartPole-v1 Spaces**

```python
import gym

# Initialize the CartPole environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')

# Inspect action space
print(f"Action Space: {env.action_space}")  # Discrete(2)

# Inspect observation space
print(f"Observation Space: {env.observation_space}")  # Box(4,)

env.close()
```

**Output:**
```
Action Space: Discrete(2)
Observation Space: Box(-4.800000190734863, 4.800000190734863, (4,), float32)
```

## **Practical Example: Interacting with the CartPole Environment**

Let's explore the **CartPole-v1** environment, one of the simplest yet effective environments in Gym.

### **Step-by-Step Interaction**

1. **Environment Creation:** Initialize the environment.
2. **Reset:** Start a new episode and obtain the initial state.
3. **Render:** Visualize the initial state.
4. **Action Selection:** Choose an action (random or specific).
5. **Step:** Apply the action and receive feedback.
6. **Render:** Visualize the new state.
7. **Close:** Properly close the environment.

```python
import gym

# Step 1: Create the CartPole environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')

# Step 2: Reset the environment to start and obtain the initial state
state = env.reset()
print(f"Initial State: {state}")

# Step 3: Render the initial state
env.render()

# Step 4: Take a random action
action = env.action_space.sample()
print(f"Random Action Taken: {action}")

# Step 5: Apply the action to the environment
next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
print(f"Next State: {next_state}")
print(f"Reward: {reward}")
print(f"Done: {done}")
print(f"Info: {info}")

# Step 6: Render the next state
env.render()

# Step 7: Close the environment
env.close()
```

### **Explanation of the Code**

- **Environment Creation:** `gym.make('CartPole-v1')` initializes the CartPole environment.
- **Reset:** `env.reset()` resets the environment and returns the initial state.
- **Render:** `env.render()` visualizes the current state of the environment.
- **Action Sampling:** `env.action_space.sample()` selects a random action from the action space.
- **Step:** `env.step(action)` applies the action, returning:
  - **next_state:** The state after the action.
  - **reward:** Immediate reward received after the action.
  - **done:** Boolean indicating if the episode has ended.
  - **info:** Additional diagnostic information (can be ignored for basic tasks).
- **Close:** `env.close()` properly closes the environment to free up resources.

for env_id in env_ids:
    print(env_id)
```

*This script will print a comprehensive list of all environments supported by your Gym installation.*

---

## **Interactive Activity**

Engage with the environments to deepen your understanding of how Gym works.

### **1. Choose and Interact with a Different Environment**

**Task:** Select a different environment from the list (e.g., `MountainCar-v0`) and modify the example code to interact with it.

```python
import gym

# Create the MountainCar environment
env = gym.make('MountainCar-v0')

# Reset the environment to start
state = env.reset()
print(f"Initial State: {state}")

# Render the initial state
env.render()

# Take a specific action (e.g., push right)
action = 2  # 0: Push Left, 1: No Push, 2: Push Right
print(f"Action Taken: {action}")

# Apply the action to the environment
next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
print(f"Next State: {next_state}")
print(f"Reward: {reward}")
print(f"Done: {done}")
print(f"Info: {info}")

# Render the next state
env.render()

# Close the environment
env.close()
```

**Expected Outcome:** Observe how the MountainCar environment responds to the action of pushing right.

### **2. Modify Actions to Observe Different Behaviors**

**Task:** Instead of taking random actions, implement a fixed policy (e.g., always push left or always push right) and observe the agent's behavior.

```python
import gym

# Create the CartPole environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
state = env.reset()
env.render()

done = False
total_reward = 0
steps = 0

while not done:
    action = 0  # 0: Push Left, 1: Push Right
    next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    env.render()
    total_reward += reward
    steps += 1

print(f"Episode finished after {steps} steps with total reward {total_reward}")

# Close the environment
env.close()
```

**Observation:** Compare how a fixed policy performs against a random policy.

### **3. Experiment with Continuous Rendering**

**Task:** Implement a loop where the agent takes random actions and continuously renders the environment to visualize the agent's behavior over multiple steps.

```python
import gym

# Create the CartPole environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
state = env.reset()

total_reward = 0
steps = 0
done = False

while not done:
    env.render()  # Render the environment
    action = env.action_space.sample()  # Take a random action
    next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    total_reward += reward
    steps += 1

print(f"Episode finished after {steps} steps with total reward {total_reward}")

# Close the environment
env.close()
```

*Run this code to see the CartPole in action with a random policy. Observe how the pole behaves with different actions.*

---

## **Quick Exercise: Implementing a Basic Interaction Loop**

**Task:** Implement a loop where the agent takes random actions until the episode ends. Track the total reward and the number of steps taken.

```python
import gym

# Initialize the CartPole environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
state = env.reset()

total_reward = 0
steps = 0
done = False

while not done:
    env.render()  # Render the environment
    action = env.action_space.sample()  # Take a random action
    next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    total_reward += reward
    steps += 1

print(f"Episode finished after {steps} steps with total reward {total_reward}")

# Close the environment
env.close()
```

**Expected Output:** A visualization of the CartPole balancing, ending when the pole falls or the cart moves out of bounds. The console will display the total number of steps and the cumulative reward.

## **Best Practices When Working with Gym Environments**

1. **Properly Close Environments:**
   - Always close the environment using `env.close()` to free up resources.
   
2. **Environment Wrappers:**
   - Utilize Gym's wrappers to modify or enhance environments without altering the original code.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     from gym.wrappers import Monitor

     env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
     env = Monitor(env, './videos', force=True)
     ```

3. **Seed for Reproducibility:**
   - Set seeds to ensure reproducible results.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     env.seed(42)
     ```

4. **Handling Render in Headless Systems:**
   - If working on a server without a display, use the `rgb_array` mode or disable rendering.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     env = gym.make('CartPole-v1', render_mode='rgb_array')
     ```

5. **Monitoring and Recording:**
   - Use Gym's `Monitor` wrapper to record episodes for later analysis.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     from gym.wrappers import Monitor

     env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
     env = Monitor(env, './videos', force=True)
     ```
