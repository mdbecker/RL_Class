# **Lesson 2.3: Understanding Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**

## **Learning Objectives**
- **Grasp the basics of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).**
- **Relate MDP components to OpenAI Gym environments.**
- **Understand the mathematical framework underpinning RL.**
- **Visualize state transitions and reward structures in MDPs.**
- **Implement a simple MDP visualization to reinforce concepts.**

## **Description**
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in environments where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of an agent. In this lesson, we'll simplify MDP concepts and relate them to practical examples within OpenAI Gym environments. By the end of this lesson, you'll understand the core components of MDPs, how they underpin RL algorithms, and how to visualize state transitions and rewards.

## **Why Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)?**

MDPs are fundamental to Reinforcement Learning as they formalize the environment in which an agent operates. Understanding MDPs is crucial for designing and analyzing RL algorithms.

**Key Reasons to Understand MDPs:**
- **Framework Foundation:** Provides a structured way to model environments.
- **Algorithm Design:** Many RL algorithms are derived based on MDP principles.
- **Performance Analysis:** Facilitates evaluation of agent behavior and policy effectiveness.
  
---
  
## **What is a Markov Decision Process (MDP)?**

An **MDP** is defined by a tuple \( (S, A, T, R, \gamma) \), where:

1. **States (\( S \)):** A finite set of states representing all possible situations in the environment.
2. **Actions (\( A \)):** A finite set of actions available to the agent.
3. **Transition Function (\( T \)):** Defines the probability \( T(s, a, s') \) of transitioning to state \( s' \) from state \( s \) after taking action \( a \).
4. **Reward Function (\( R \)):** Provides immediate rewards \( R(s, a, s') \) based on state-action-state transitions.
5. **Discount Factor (\( \gamma \)):** A scalar between 0 and 1 that determines the importance of future rewards.

### **Key Characteristics of MDPs**

- **Markov Property:** The future state depends only on the current state and action, not on the sequence of events that preceded it.
- **Deterministic vs. Stochastic:** 
  - **Deterministic MDPs:** Transition and reward functions are deterministic.
  - **Stochastic MDPs:** Transition and/or reward functions are probabilistic.

## **Relating MDP Components to OpenAI Gym Environments**

Understanding how MDP components map to practical environments like those in OpenAI Gym helps bridge theory with practice.

### **Example: CartPole-v1**

| **MDP Component**    | **CartPole-v1 Representation**                                         |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **States (\( S \))** | Position and velocity of the cart and pole (continuous values).        |
| **Actions (\( A \))**| Move cart left (`0`) or right (`1`) (discrete actions).                |
| **Transition (\( T \))** | Physics-based updates of state based on action, introducing stochasticity. |
| **Rewards (\( R \))** | +1 for every step the pole remains upright; 0 otherwise.             |
| **Discount Factor (\( \gamma \))** | Typically set close to 1 (e.g., 0.99) to value future rewards. |

### **Another Example: MountainCar-v0**

| **MDP Component**    | **MountainCar-v0 Representation**                                      |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **States (\( S \))** | Position and velocity of the car (continuous values).                 |
| **Actions (\( A \))**| Push left (`0`), no push (`1`), or push right (`2`) (discrete actions). |
| **Transition (\( T \))** | Physics-based updates, often deterministic.                        |
| **Rewards (\( R \))** | -1 for each step until the goal is reached.                          |
| **Discount Factor (\( \gamma \))** | Typically set to 1 as the task requires reaching the goal.      |

## **Practical Example: Visualizing State Transitions**

Visualizing how actions influence state transitions can deepen your understanding of MDPs. Let's implement a simple visualization in the CartPole environment.

```python
import gym
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Initialize the CartPole environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
state = env.reset()
env.render()

# Define actions
actions = [0, 1]  # 0: Push Left, 1: Push Right

# Store states and actions for visualization
states = [state]
selected_actions = [None]

for action in actions:
    next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    states.append(next_state)
    selected_actions.append(action)
    action_name = 'Left' if action == 0 else 'Right'
    print(f"Action Taken: {action_name}")
    print(f"Next State: {next_state}\n")
    if done:
        break

env.close()

# Extract state components
positions = [s[0] for s in states]
velocities = [s[1] for s in states]
angles = [s[2] for s in states]
angular_velocities = [s[3] for s in states]

# Plotting the state transitions
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(14, 10))

axs[0, 0].plot(positions, marker='o', color='blue')
axs[0, 0].set_title('Cart Position')
axs[0, 0].set_xlabel('Step')
axs[0, 0].set_ylabel('Position')

axs[0, 1].plot(velocities, marker='o', color='orange')
axs[0, 1].set_title('Cart Velocity')
axs[0, 1].set_xlabel('Step')
axs[0, 1].set_ylabel('Velocity')

axs[1, 0].plot(angles, marker='o', color='green')
axs[1, 0].set_title('Pole Angle')
axs[1, 0].set_xlabel('Step')
axs[1, 0].set_ylabel('Angle')

axs[1, 1].plot(angular_velocities, marker='o', color='red')
axs[1, 1].set_title('Pole Angular Velocity')
axs[1, 1].set_xlabel('Step')
axs[1, 1].set_ylabel('Angular Velocity')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### **Explanation of the Code**
- **State Extraction:** Extracts individual components of the state for detailed visualization.
- **Visualization:** Plots how each state component changes with each action, highlighting the impact of actions on the environment's dynamics.

## **Understanding the MDP Framework**

### **Formal Definition of an MDP**

An MDP is defined by the tuple \( (S, A, T, R, \gamma) \):
- **\( S \)**: Set of all possible states.
- **\( A \)**: Set of all possible actions.
- **\( T(s, a, s') \)**: Probability of transitioning to state \( s' \) from state \( s \) after taking action \( a \).
- **\( R(s, a, s') \)**: Reward received after transitioning from state \( s \) to state \( s' \) via action \( a \).
- **\( \gamma \)**: Discount factor for future rewards.

### **Example: CartPole MDP Components**

- **States (\( S \))**: Continuous variables representing cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, and pole angular velocity.
- **Actions (\( A \))**: Discrete actions {0: Left, 1: Right}.
- **Transition (\( T \))**: Governed by the physics of the CartPole system, introducing stochasticity based on initial conditions and actions.
- **Rewards (\( R \))**: +1 for every time step the pole remains upright; 0 otherwise.
- **Discount Factor (\( \gamma \))**: Typically set close to 1 (e.g., 0.99) to value future rewards almost as much as immediate rewards.

## **Interactive Activity**

### **1. Define MDP Components for a New Environment**

**Task:** Choose an environment from Gym (e.g., `MountainCar-v0`) and identify its MDP components.

```python
import gym

# Initialize the MountainCar environment
env = gym.make('MountainCar-v0')

# Inspect action space
print(f"Action Space: {env.action_space}")  # Discrete(3)

# Inspect observation space
print(f"Observation Space: {env.observation_space}")  # Box(2,)

# Define MDP components for MountainCar-v0
mdp_components = {
    "States (S)": "Position and velocity of the car.",
    "Actions (A)": "Push Left (0), No Push (1), Push Right (2).",
    "Transition (T)": "Physics-based updates of state based on action.",
    "Rewards (R)": "-1 for each step until the goal is reached.",
    "Discount Factor (γ)": "Typically set to 1 as the task requires reaching the goal."
}

print("\nMDP Components for MountainCar-v0:")
for component, description in mdp_components.items():
    print(f"{component}: {description}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Action Space: Discrete(3)
Observation Space: Box([-1.2 -0.07], [0.6 0.07], (2,), float32)

MDP Components for MountainCar-v0:
States (S): Position and velocity of the car.
Actions (A): Push Left (0), No Push (1), Push Right (2).
Transition (T): Physics-based updates of state based on action.
Rewards (R): -1 for each step until the goal is reached.
Discount Factor (γ): Typically set to 1 as the task requires reaching the goal.
```

### **2. State Transition Visualization**

**Task:** Implement a function to visualize state transitions for a sequence of actions in a chosen environment.

```python
import gym
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def visualize_state_transitions(env_name, actions):
    env = gym.make(env_name)
    state = env.reset()
    env.render()
    
    states = [state]
    selected_actions = [None]
    
    for action in actions:
        next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        states.append(next_state)
        selected_actions.append(action)
        action_name = f"Action {action}: " + ("Left" if action == 0 else "No Push" if action ==1 else "Right")
        print(f"{action_name}")
        print(f"Next State: {next_state}\n")
        if done:
            break
    
    env.close()
    
    # Example visualization for MountainCar
    if env_name == 'MountainCar-v0':
        positions = [s[0] for s in states]
        velocities = [s[1] for s in states]
        
        fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 5))
        
        axs[0].plot(positions, marker='o', color='blue')
        axs[0].set_title('Car Position')
        axs[0].set_xlabel('Step')
        axs[0].set_ylabel('Position')
        
        axs[1].plot(velocities, marker='o', color='purple')
        axs[1].set_title('Car Velocity')
        axs[1].set_xlabel('Step')
        axs[1].set_ylabel('Velocity')
        
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.show()
    else:
        # For environments with more state dimensions, plot selectively
        positions = [s[0] for s in states]
        velocities = [s[1] for s in states]
        angles = [s[2] for s in states] if len(s) > 2 else []
        angular_velocities = [s[3] for s in states] if len(s) > 3 else []
        
        fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(14, 10))
        
        axs[0, 0].plot(positions, marker='o', color='blue')
        axs[0, 0].set_title('Cart Position')
        axs[0, 0].set_xlabel('Step')
        axs[0, 0].set_ylabel('Position')
        
        axs[0, 1].plot(velocities, marker='o', color='orange')
        axs[0, 1].set_title('Cart Velocity')
        axs[0, 1].set_xlabel('Step')
        axs[0, 1].set_ylabel('Velocity')
        
        if angles:
            axs[1, 0].plot(angles, marker='o', color='green')
            axs[1, 0].set_title('Pole Angle')
            axs[1, 0].set_xlabel('Step')
            axs[1, 0].set_ylabel('Angle')
        
        if angular_velocities:
            axs[1, 1].plot(angular_velocities, marker='o', color='red')
            axs[1, 1].set_title('Pole Angular Velocity')
            axs[1, 1].set_xlabel('Step')
            axs[1, 1].set_ylabel('Angular Velocity')
        
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.show()

# Example usage with MountainCar-v0
actions = [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1]
visualize_state_transitions('MountainCar-v0', actions)
```

**Explanation:**
- **Functionality:** The `visualize_state_transitions` function takes an environment name and a list of actions, executes them sequentially, and visualizes the state transitions.
- **Flexibility:** Handles different environments by adjusting the number of state dimensions plotted.
  
**Expected Output:**
- **Console Output:** Prints each action taken and the resulting state.
- **Plots:** Visual representations of state transitions (e.g., car position and velocity in MountainCar-v0).

### **3. Compare Different Action Sequences**

**Task:** Run the visualization with different action sequences to observe how they affect state transitions.

```python
# Example usage with different action sequences in MountainCar-v0
actions_sequence_1 = [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1]
actions_sequence_2 = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

print("=== Action Sequence 1 ===")
visualize_state_transitions('MountainCar-v0', actions_sequence_1)

print("=== Action Sequence 2 ===")
visualize_state_transitions('MountainCar-v0', actions_sequence_2)
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- **Action Sequence 1:** A mix of pushing left, no push, and pushing right, showing varied state transitions.
- **Action Sequence 2:** Consistently pushing right, demonstrating the cumulative effect on the car's position and velocity.

    "Discount Factor (\( \gamma \))": "Typically set to 0.99 to value future rewards."
}

print("\nMDP Components for Acrobot-v1:")
for component, description in mdp_components.items():
    print(f"{component}: {description}")
```

```

```

### **2. State Transition Visualization for Acrobot-v1**

**Task:** Visualize state transitions for a sequence of actions in the Acrobot environment.

```python
import gym
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def visualize_state_transitions(env_name, actions):
    env = gym.make(env_name)
    state = env.reset()
    env.render()
    
    states = [state]
    selected_actions = [None]
    
    for action in actions:
        next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        states.append(next_state)
        selected_actions.append(action)
        action_name = f"Action {action}: " + ("Push Left (-1)" if action ==0 else "No Push (0)" else "Push Right (+1)")
        print(f"{action_name}")
        print(f"Next State: {next_state}\n")
        if done:

    env.close()
    
    # Visualization for Acrobot-v1
    if env_name == 'Acrobot-v1':
        angles1 = [s[0] for s in states]
        angles2 = [s[1] for s in states]
        angular_velocities1 = [s[2] for s in states]
        angular_velocities2 = [s[3] for s in states]
        torque = [s[4] for s in states] if len(s) >4 else []
        torque2 = [s[5] for s in states] if len(s) >5 else []
        
        fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 2, figsize=(14, 12))

        axs[0, 1].set_xlabel('Step')
        axs[0, 1].set_ylabel('Angle (rad)')
        
        axs[1, 0].plot(angular_velocities1, marker='o', color='green')
        axs[1, 0].set_title('Link 1 Angular Velocity')
        axs[1, 0].set_xlabel('Step')
        axs[1, 0].set_ylabel('Angular Velocity (rad/s)')

            axs[2, 1].set_title('Torque 2')
            axs[2, 1].set_xlabel('Step')
            axs[2, 1].set_ylabel('Torque')
        
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.show()

# Example usage with Acrobot-v1
actions = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2]
visualize_state_transitions('Acrobot-v1', actions)
```

**Explanation:**
- **Functionality:** The `visualize_state_transitions` function handles different environments by adjusting the number of state dimensions plotted.
- **Visualization:** For `Acrobot-v1`, it plots angles and angular velocities of both links, providing a comprehensive view of the system's dynamics.

### **3. Compare Different Action Sequences**

**Task:** Run the visualization with different action sequences and observe how they affect the state transitions.

```python
# Example usage with different action sequences in Acrobot-v1
actions_sequence_1 = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2]
actions_sequence_2 = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

print("=== Action Sequence 1 ===")
visualize_state_transitions('Acrobot-v1', actions_sequence_1)

print("=== Action Sequence 2 ===")
visualize_state_transitions('Acrobot-v1', actions_sequence_2)
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- **Action Sequence 1:** A mix of pushing left, no push, and pushing right, showing varied state transitions.
- **Action Sequence 2:** Consistently pushing right, demonstrating the cumulative effect on the links' angles and angular velocities.

## **Quick Exercise: Implementing a Simple MDP Visualization**

**Task:** Implement a function to visualize state transitions for a sequence of actions in the `FrozenLake-v1` environment.

```python
import gym
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def visualize_frozenlake_transitions(env_name, actions):
    env = gym.make(env_name, is_slippery=False)  # deterministic transitions
    state = env.reset()
    env.render()
    
    states = [state]
    selected_actions = [None]
    
    for action in actions:
        next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        states.append(next_state)
        selected_actions.append(action)
        action_name = {0: "Left", 1: "Down", 2: "Right", 3: "Up"}.get(action, "Unknown")
        print(f"Action Taken: {action_name}")
        print(f"Next State: {next_state}\n")
        env.render()
        if done:
            break
    
    env.close()
    
    # Visualize state transitions on the grid
    grid_size = int(np.sqrt(env.observation_space.n))
    grid = np.array(states).reshape(-1, grid_size)
    
    print("Grid Representation of States:")
    print(grid)

# Example usage with FrozenLake-v1
actions = [2, 2, 1, 1, 3]  # Right, Right, Down, Down, Up
visualize_frozenlake_transitions('FrozenLake-v1', actions)
```

**Explanation:**
- **Environment:** `FrozenLake-v1` is a grid-based environment where the agent navigates from start to goal while avoiding holes.
- **Deterministic Transitions:** Setting `is_slippery=False` makes the environment deterministic for clearer visualization.
- **Visualization:** Prints the grid representation of states visited during the episode.
